# equation-calculator

Completely separate repository for my equation calculator that I've been working on. It parses latex-strings and returns a list of steps required to solve it if it's able to solve it.

Current version is integrated with Angular and is made with ES5. This version will be completely separate library and it will be made with ES6.
